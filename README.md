# Grade-Calculator
To use, place the java file in your deliverables folder then compile and run from the command line. Ensure that the latest grades have been pulled from the remote repository prior to usage. The overall and current percent grade are calculated based upon the proportions outlined in the course syllabus. This program assumes the format for grade.report files will remain consistent and will not function properly otherwise. It accepts the following optional command line arguments:

## CLI Arguments
  * total   - returns total amount of points irrespective of category
  * points  - returns points for each category
  * percent - returns calculation of grade

Otherwise it will output all of the above.
